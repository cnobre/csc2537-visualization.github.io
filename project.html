		  <h2>What do you mean by "research project"?</h2>
		</header>

		<p> <b>Your project must be about research, and not engineering! </b><br/>

		  While most projects build and evaluate a prototype system, programming is not strictly necessary. Some perceptual or cognitive psychology studies, e.g. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718533">(Xiong, van Weelden, and Franconeri, 2019)</a>,  <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/communication/Bateman2010.pdf">(Batman et al., 2010)</a>, taxonomies, e.g. <a href="https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01868738/document">Dimara et al., 2018</a>), in-depth qualitative user research, e.g. <a href="http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/supplemental/Active-Reading-of-Visualizations/walny2017_activereading%20(preprint).pdf">(Walny et al., 2018)</a>, research practices and methods <a href="https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/110211/DIS_2019_Sketching_and_Ideation_Activities_for_Situated_Visualization_Design.pdf">(Bressa et al., 2019)</a>, and beyond-the-desktop exploratory works, e.g. <a href="https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/133260/1/TEI_19_potato_Author_Accepted.pdf">(Wun et al., 2019)</a>, are all examples of research contributions that do not involve programming. <b>A research contribution is not equal to engineering: the methodology employed, the originality of the research and technical soundness of the work are most important </b>. A well-crafted application will not be a subsitute for research quality and contribution.</p>

		<p> <b>Determining your main research contribution.</b><br/>
		  You should carefully think about what your project's main contribution is. Tamara Munzner's guide to writing information visualiztion research papers will help you define where your contribution lies, through the description of paper types <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/pitfalls.pdf">(Munzner, 2007)</a>: technique, design study (which may or may not involve the implementation of a functional prototype), systems, evaluation, and model. <b> Being able to clearly articulate your main research contribution (and secondary contributions) is essential.</b> You should engage in this exercise early in the project development, and keep iterating on the formulation of your contribitions. It will help you choose the appropriate validation method(s), will help you guide your work, will help you better frame your paper, and ulitmately, it will help the reader understand what your work has to offer. 

		<p> <b>Every research project requires validation.</b><br/>
		  Note that validation doesn't necessarily mean a lab experiment. While thorough user studies will be expected of projects that do not involve system building (e.g. design studies, perceptual studies), validation of a prototype can be in the form of use case scenarios for instance. There are many validation methods to choose from. An appropriate validation method depends on the research question and the main contribution. Tamara Munzner's <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/pitfalls.pdf">Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers (Munzner, 2007)</a> write-up discusses validation methods for different paper types. A more complete, excellent resource is her <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2009/NestedModel/NestedModel.pdf">"Nested Model for Visualization Design and Validation" (Munzner, 2009)</a>. Discuss with your instructor what validation steps are crtical to integrate in your case, if you are unsure. <b>Similarly to a project involving developement, the methodology, originality and technical soundness of the work will be evaluated.</b> </p>

		<p> <b>Work hard. Aim for the best.</b><br/>
		  We will encourage author(s) of excellent projects to further extend their work and submit to the <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome"> IEEE VIS Short Papers, or Posters track (deadline in June)</a>. You must have IRB clearance prior to conducting your study if you plan a later submission of your work that includes user data.</p>

		    <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
		  </header>

		  <p>An important part of your course work is to articulate a research question and make a plan to address it. 
		    To do this, you'll need to: 1) read a lot of papers in an area of interest, and 2) generate a lot of ideas. 
		    Leveraging an existing project on campus will get you to a novel idea quicker, increase your impact, and be more rewarding. The goal of the project abstract is to help you scope your work appropriately and devise a solid plan to conduct your research.
		  </p>
		  
		  
		  <h3> Description </h3>
		  <p> Submit a <b>meaningful title</b> and an <b>abstract</b> describing your project. Please also attach a <b>short biography</b> (a few words about you and why you take this class), as well as a <b>portrait photograph</b> (headshot) of yourself.</p>
		  <p> The abstract (max 1 page, excluding images and references) can be seen as a preliminary draft of the introduction of the research paper (i.e. project report) that you will submit at the end of the term.

		    The abstract should describe the topic of your project: <i>motivation</i>, e.g., why it is important (why care? who cares?), why it is difficult) and the <i>research question</i> that you are trying to address, 
			a <i>brief positioning</i> (what has been done in the area, and why these prior works are limited; 
			what are prior works you bear inspiration from and why), a description of your 
			envisioned <i>research methodology</i> and <i>expected contributions</i> as well as the associated <i>limitations and risks</i>. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		    <h3> How will it be graded? </h3>

		    The following components will be evaluated in this assignment. 
		    
		    
		    <table class="thirty">
		      <tr></tr>
		      <tr>
			<td> Motivation (1 pt) </td>
		      </tr>
		      <tr>

		      </tr>
		      <tr>
			<td> Limitations and Risks (1 pt) </td>
		      </tr>
		    </table>

		    Your written documents should be of top professional quality. Note that points will be substracted subject to the following motives: missing components, poor presentation (e.g. poor formatting), lack of clarity (e.g. poor writing, poor organization).
		  </p>

		  
		  
		  <p>
		    <h3> Submission instructions </h3>
		    Submit your abstract (max 1 page; images, references and short biographies do not count toward the page limit) in the PDF format on Quercus, by the submission deadline. <br />
		    Make sure your submission includes a project title, and the name, short biography and headshot of every group member.

		  <h2>Mid-term Project Video</h2>
		</header>

		<p>Another important part of your course work is to effectively communicate your research using different communication mediums. 
		  In human-computer interaction and visualization research in particular, video presentations are commonplace to explain and demonstrate research contributions involving (oftentimes highly interactive) visual content. The goal of this assignment is for you to practice with the design and making of a research video. To do this, you'll need to: 1) watch a lot of research videos for inspiration, 2) plan your video carefully using storyboarding and scripting, and 3) make a professional-quality, concise video explaining and demonstrating your research. This video will then be shared to the rest of the class, who will provide feedback, comments and questions to each group.
		</p>
		
		<h3> Description </h3>
		<p>
		  Submit a <b>short video</b> (3-5min) describing your project.<br/>
		  The content of the video is entirely up to you. The focus is on effective communication of what your research project is about, and what is your approach to address the research question(s). Typically, the video presentation would cover the following aspects: <i>motivation</i>, e.g., why it is important (why care? who cares? why is it difficult?) and the <i>research question(s)</i> that you are trying to address, a description of your envisioned <i>research methodology</i> and associated <i>limitations and risks</i>. Usually, including prior works in research videos is not necessary, however, it is up to you to include, if you feel it best serves your message. You may also include progress to date and/or mock sketches of envisioned solution or study design. Be creative, be compelling, engage your viewers! Tell your audience an intersting story through your video.

		  <h2>Peer Feedback on Projects</h2>
		</header>

		<p>Good research doesn't happen in a vaccum. Rather, it is often the result of multiple iterations, building on constructive critique and questions from peers, domain experts, and beyond. This is why communicating about your work at different stages of its development is essential for obtaining valuable feedback to improve. The goal of this assignment is to generate such feedback to help every group improve on their work. </p>
		
		<h3> Description </h3>
		<p>
		  Provide <b>written feedback</b> to other groups assigned to you on their project, based on the video presentation (these will be communicated via Quercus mail).<br/>
		  Your feedback should include positive comments on what you found to be good; constructive and actionable comments, such as what you had difficulties understanding and could be clarified, what the researchers may want to consider but didn't talk about; and questions to the group, if any. While comments on the video format are welcome, they are secondary: your feedback should focus primarily on the research itself.
		</p>

		<p> The book <i>Discussing Design : Improving Communication and Collaboration Through Critique, by Adam Connor and Aaron Irizarry, O'Reilly Media, 2015. ISBN: 9781491902400.</i> is a useful guide on how to seek, and provide feedback. In particular, the <a href="https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/lib/utoronto/reader.action?docID=3564537&ppg=19">Chapter 1: Understanding Critique</a> and <a href="https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/lib/utoronto/reader.action?docID=3564537&ppg=19">Chapter 2: What Critique Looks Like</a> are important resources that you are strongly encouraged to read.</p>

		  <h2>Project presentation</h2>
		</header>

		<p> The most important thing about doing projects is sharing the final result with other people. The goal of this assignment is to explain your entire project and process to the audience (i.e. the class and possibly external guests), in an engaging way, to convince them that your project idea and research contribution are solid, important and intersting.</p>

		<h3> Description </h3>

		<p>
		  The final presentation should mostly focus on the work you have realized, your research contribution(s) (i.e., field study, design rationales, demo/description of the solution, usability study, evaluation, ...). Intro / motivation / related work, while worth including, should remain concise. Each group will have <b>7 minutes to present</b>. This time limit will be strictly enforced, and your time begins as soon as the previous group ends. There will be 3 minutes of Q&A after each presentation.</p>

		<p>The final presentation should be seen as a simulation of conference presentation. Given that both live remote presentations and pre-recorded presentations are now standard modes of delivery in conference, groups can choose between practicing their live presentation skills, or record their presentation in advance. It's up to your team which mode of delivery you prefer.</p>

		  <h2>Research report</h2>
		</header>
		
		In addition to the presentation, you will present your findings in a final paper. <br/><br/>
		
		<h3> Description </h3>

		<p>
		  Final papers should be 3-5 pages long in the two-column format as follows: <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2020/submission-templates/SIGCHI-UIST2020-Sample-Paper.docx">Word</a> | <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2020/submission-templates/SIGCHI-UIST2020-proceedings.zip">LaTeX</a> | <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uist2020-overleaf-template/jdrxpnpcccgk">Overleaf</a>. While this may sound short, it is much harder to write an effective, complete short paper than it is to ramble. A good approach to writing a great short paper is to write a long one first, and then trim it down to the most vital parts. Appendices are acceptable and optional (they don't count towards the page limit), but won't be graded. Add one for materials you want an interested reader to see (for example, when we post your project on the website for next year), but don't need to be graded. Page limit excludes references.
		  The final report should be seen as a research paper submission, short format (3-5 pages, references do not count toward page limit). 
		  As such, it should include all of the components of a reasearch paper (strong motivation, positioning, clear statement of the reseach question and contribution, ...). 
		  Most of the papers presented in class are good example of good quality research papers (you should read all papers presented in this class!). You are also strongly encouraged to carefully read Muzner's <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/pitfalls.pdf">advice on writing visualization research papers</a>, as well as these <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088278v5">simple rules to structuring research papers.</a>

		  <h2>Notes on IRB</h2>
		</header>

		In general, when students undertake a behavioral science class project (like most HCI), IRB approval is not required. 
		That said, here are three things to know:
		<br/> &nbsp; &#9642; &nbsp; NO data collected as part of a class project may EVER be published unless you receive IRB approval BEFORE beginning to collect data. This is not something that can change later. We encourage PhD students taking the class to apply for IRB, especially given that the IRB process for studying interfaces is streamlined, i.e., usually receives Exempt status. (This is why we offer extra credit for completing the CITI training course, so that you're set up to apply for IRB.) With IRB approval, you can publish your work if something great emerges.
		<br/> &nbsp; &#9642; &nbsp; Even for class projects that are not subject to IRB jurisdiction, you still have a responsibility to protect the welfare of those participating in your class project.
		<br/> &nbsp; &#9642; &nbsp; If you would like to record sensitive personal information (like health information) you MUST show me written IRB approval/exemption prior to doing so, even if you don't intend to publish your work.
